This is an example blog post to showcase what's possible with Markdown, an HTML formatting language.

Using Markdown, you can write in italics like: _Hello, italics!_ or bold: __Hello, bold!__

You can create bulleted lists
- hi
  - yes
- hola
  - holaaa
- howdy

Or ordered lists
1. hi
2. hola
3. howdy

You can include images or gifs that are hosted on your website in the `public/` folder like so:
<img src="/public/NVC_Timelapse-shana-7-25-2022.gif" style="max-width: 500px;" />

or images that are hosted in different locations like this one:
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925124i/71730.jpg" style="max-height: 200px;" />

Note the inclusion of the CSS `style` attribute on each of those images. That is where you can write CSS to customize the formatting. Learn more [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp).

and much more...

<video controls style="margin-top:20px; width: 300px;">
  <source src="/public/video/personal-purpose-LV-interview.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
