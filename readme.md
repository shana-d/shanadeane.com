# Before you begin

I recommend developing your website on a laptop so that you can view your website locally before you push it to the actual world wide web. To do this, youâ€™ll need git to allow uploading your code to github and ruby and Jekyll to allow serving your code to your local web browser.

- git (mac) <https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/> (windows) <https://git-scm.com/download/windows>
- ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#installers>
- Jekyll <https://jekyllrb.com/>

# View website locally

1. open terminal
2. navigate to your website's folder like
```cd ~/Documents/Website/shanadeane.com```
3. run
```bundle exec jekyll serve -l```
4. open web browser! http://127.0.0.1:4000/

2. Open terminal
3. ```git add . && git commit -m "my work"``` where _my work_ is a breif description of what you changed
4. ```git push```
5. Wait 60 seconds and check your website!

# Edit HTML and CSS
First, you should have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS

Next, you can use this tutorial to guide you through how to override the Jekyll theme defaults by copying the `_includes`, `_head`, etc directories into your repo where you can then edit them and have them be used when your site is served by the `bundle exec jekyll serve -l` command.
